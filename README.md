# rob314

Primitive version, still needs to manually select the cloud to follow

TODOs:
- select automatically the person from the cloud in the first iteraction and get it as first measure;
- verify the cases where the pointcloud is lost or too different (re-analize all the cloud);
- fix the XY inversion in frame, specially with the robot moving frame
- change the KF to take into account the movement of the robot
- publish the pointCloud without the person


This hole projecthas this module but also a [insert link] controller and a [insert link] SLAM.
